## SOLID Principles
**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class or module should focus on a single task or responsibility.
**Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: Be able to add new functionality to existing code easily without modifying existing code.
**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: When a class inherits from another class, the program shouldn't break and you shouldn't need to hack anything to use the subclass
**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Make interfaces (parent abstract classes) more specific, rather than generic
**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Make classes depend on abstract classes rather than non-abstract classes.
